# DevOps Engineer

**DevOps Engineering** is a practice that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It emphasizes automation, collaboration, and integration between development and operations teams to improve agility and efficiency.

## DevOps lifecycle:


**1. Plan:** Begin with planning the next iteration of the development process. This involves gathering requirements, defining tasks, and scheduling work.

**2. Code:** Developers write code, often using version control systems like Git to manage changes and collaborate.

**3. Build:** The code is compiled into a runnable instance, with tools like Maven or Gradle being used for building the software.

**4. Test:** Automated tests are run to ensure quality and functionality. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and sometimes user acceptance testing. 

**5. Release:** The software is prepared for release to a production-like environment. This step often involves final testing stages and the configuration of the release.

**6. Deploy:** Automated deployment tools (like Jenkins, Spinnaker, or Ansible) deploy the software to production environments.

**7. Operate:** The operation team manages and maintains the system to ensure it performs optimally.

**8. Monitor:** The entire infrastructure and application are monitored for issues. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack are used to log and visualize performance.

**9. Feedback and Optimize:** Feedback from monitoring tools and from users is gathered and analyzed to identify areas for improvement.

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository, preferably several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

**Continuous Deployment** is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. It extends the Continuous Integration process by deploying all code changes to a testing environment, and sometimes to a production-like environment, after the build stage.
